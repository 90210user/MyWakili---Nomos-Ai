3. Tech Stack

The website is built with a robust and modern technology stack to ensure performance, scalability, and ease of development:
Component	Technology	Purpose
Frontend	Vite	Fast build tool for development and production.
Frontend	TypeScript	Adds type safety to JavaScript for robust code.
Frontend	TailwindCSS	Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI styling.
Frontend	React.js	Component-based library for dynamic interfaces.
Backend	Firebase	Handles authentication, database, and serverless functions.
APIs	OpenAI	Powers AI-driven legal advice and research.
APIs	Daraja	Facilitates M-Pesa payment processing.
4. Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

    Frontend: A single-page React application hosted on Firebase Hosting.
    Backend: Firebase Cloud Functions handle server-side logic, API calls, and integrations.
    Database: Firestore stores user data, chat histories, and payment records.
    External APIs: OpenAI for AI processing and Daraja for payment transactions.

5. Data Models

Firestore collections are designed to store essential data:
Collection	Fields	Description
Users	userId: string, email: string, name: string, language: string, createdAt: timestamp, lastLogin: timestamp	Stores user profiles and preferences.
Chats	chatId: string, userId: string, messages: array[{role: string, content: string, timestamp: timestamp}]	Stores chat histories for each user.
Payments	paymentId: string, userId: string, amount: number, currency: string, status: string, createdAt: timestamp	Tracks payment transactions.
6. API Integrations
6.1 OpenAI API

    Purpose: Generates legal advice and summarizes research queries.
    Implementation: Cloud Functions construct prompts (e.g., “You are a legal assistant in Kenya. Provide advice in [language]: [query]”) and call OpenAI’s endpoints.
    Challenges: Ensuring accuracy in Kenyan law may require contextual data, as OpenAI’s models rely on training data up to a certain point.

6.2 Daraja API

    Purpose: Processes M-Pesa payments for services.
    Implementation: Cloud Functions handle payment initiation (e.g., STK Push) and confirmation, storing results in Firestore.
    Endpoints: Includes C2B, B2C, and Transaction Status APIs, as per Safaricom’s documentation.

7. User Flow

    Homepage: Users view services and are prompted to sign up or log in.
    Authentication: Users sign up/log in via Firebase Authentication.
    Service Selection: Users choose services like legal advice or research.
    Real-time Legal Advice:
        Users enter a chat interface and type a question.
        The frontend sends the query to a Cloud Function.
        The function queries OpenAI and returns the response.
        The response is displayed and saved in Firestore.
    Legal Research:
        Users enter a search query.
        The system retrieves and summarizes relevant legal content.
        Results are displayed in a list or grid.
    Payments:
        Users select a paid service and enter payment details.
        The frontend calls a Cloud Function to initiate payment via Daraja.
        Payment status is updated and shown.

8. Security and Privacy

    Authentication: Firebase Authentication ensures secure user access.
    Data Access: Firestore security rules restrict data to authorized users.
    Encryption: Sensitive data (e.g., chat histories) is encrypted at rest.
    Compliance: Adheres to data protection regulations, with disclaimers about AI limitations.

9. Scalability

    Firebase: Scales automatically to handle increased traffic.
    Optimization: Cloud Functions are optimized for performance and cost.
    Caching: Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce latency.

10. Deployment

    Frontend: Deployed on Firebase Hosting using the Firebase CLI.
    Backend: Cloud Functions are deployed via Firebase CLI.
    Domain: A custom domain is configured to point to Firebase Hosting.

11. Future Enhancements

    Legal Database Integration: Partner with Kenya Law or similar for comprehensive data.
    Advanced AI: Develop personalized legal assistants or predictive analytics.
    Mobile Apps: Create iOS and Android applications.
    Global Expansion: Extend services to other jurisdictions.

12. Challenges and Considerations

    Legal Accuracy: AI-generated legal advice may lack precision without up-to-date Kenyan law data. A disclaimer is necessary to clarify that AI is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
    Data Access: The absence of a public Kenyan law API may require manual data collection or partnerships.
    Ethical AI: Ensure AI responses are unbiased and culturally sensitive.
    Cost Management: Monitor OpenAI and Firebase usage to control costs.
